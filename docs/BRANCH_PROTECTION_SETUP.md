# Branch Protection Setup for Solo Projects

## 🎯 **Recommended Configuration**

For solo projects where you can't approve your own PRs, use this setup with **disabled approval requirements** and **main branch locking**:

### **Branch Protection Rules**

#### **For `main` branch (Production):**
```
✅ Require a pull request before merging
❌ Require approvals: DISABLE THIS (uncheck the box)
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging:
   - CI/CD Pipeline
   - PR Quality Check
   - Test Coverage
✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
🔒 LOCK BRANCH (maximum protection)
```

#### **For `develop` branch (Development):**
```
✅ Require a pull request before merging
❌ Require approvals: DISABLE THIS (uncheck the box)
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging:
   - CI/CD Pipeline
   - PR Quality Check
   - Test Coverage
✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
✅ Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests
   - Add @BritainSmith (for emergency fixes)
❌ DON'T LOCK (keep flexible for development)
```

## 🛡️ **Solo Development Workflow**

With disabled approval requirements, you can:

### **Normal Development Flow**
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push branch and create PR
4. All checks run automatically
5. Merge immediately when checks pass
6. No approval needed!

### **Emergency Override (develop branch only)**
- Direct push capability for urgent fixes
- Only available on develop, not main
- Use sparingly for true emergencies

### **Main Branch Protection**
- **Locked** - No direct pushes possible
- **All changes must go through PR workflow**
- **Unlock only for critical security fixes**
- **Maximum protection for production code**

## 🔄 **Workflow for Solo Development**

1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
2. **Make changes and commit**: `git commit -m "feat: add new feature"`
3. **Push branch**: `git push origin feature/new-feature`
4. **Create PR to develop**: Use GitHub's "Compare & pull request" button
5. **Wait for checks**: All CI/CD checks run automatically
6. **Merge to develop**: Click "Merge pull request" when checks pass
7. **Create PR to main**: When ready for production
8. **Merge to main**: After thorough testing on develop
9. **Clean up**: Delete the feature branch after merge

## 🛡️ **Security Benefits**

Even with disabled approval requirements, you still get:
- ✅ **Status check enforcement** (tests, linting, coverage)
- ✅ **PR history** for all changes
- ✅ **Branch protection** against accidental direct pushes
- ✅ **Conversation tracking** for future reference
- ✅ **Code review workflow** when collaborating
- ✅ **Emergency override capability** (develop branch)
- ✅ **Maximum production protection** (main branch locked)

## 🔧 **For Future Collaboration**

When you add collaborators:
1. **Increase required approvals** to 1 or more
2. **Remove bypass permissions** (or keep for emergencies)
3. **Collaborators will need your approval** to merge
4. **You can still override** when needed (if you keep bypass permissions)
5. **Keep main branch locked** for maximum production safety

## 📝 **Best Practices**

### **When to Use PR Workflow:**
- ✅ **All normal development** - Always use PRs
- ✅ **Feature development** - Create PRs for all features
- ✅ **Bug fixes** - Use PRs for bug fixes
- ✅ **Documentation updates** - Use PRs for docs

### **When to Use Direct Push (develop only):**
- ✅ **Emergency hotfixes** - Critical security fixes
- ✅ **CI/CD fixes** - When PRs can't be created
- ✅ **Documentation typos** - Minor text fixes

### **When to Unlock Main Branch:**
- ✅ **Critical security vulnerabilities** - Immediate fixes needed
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline breaks** - When PRs can't be created
- ✅ **Database migrations** - When direct access is required

### **When NOT to Use Direct Push:**
- ❌ **Feature development** - Always use PRs
- ❌ **Breaking changes** - Always use PRs
- ❌ **Main branch** - Never direct push to main (it's locked anyway)

## 🎯 **GitHub Settings Location**

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/BritainSmith/job-hopper-mvp`
2. Click **Settings** → **Branches**
3. Click **Add rule** or edit existing rules
4. Configure as shown above
5. **Key**: Disable "Require approvals" for solo development
6. **Key**: Lock the main branch for maximum protection

## 🔄 **Migration Path for Collaboration**

When you're ready to add collaborators:

1. **Update branch protection rules**:
   ```
   ✅ Require approvals: 1 (or more)
   ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   ✅ Require review from code owners
   ```

2. **Keep bypass permissions** for emergencies:
   ```
   ✅ Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests
   - Keep @BritainSmith for emergency fixes
   ```

3. **Keep main branch locked**:
   ```
   🔒 LOCK BRANCH (maintain maximum protection)
   ```

4. **Update CODEOWNERS** to include new collaborators

**Note**: This setup gives you immediate merge capability while maintaining professional development practices and maximum production protection.
