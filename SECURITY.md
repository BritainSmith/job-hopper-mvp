## 🔍 Security Checklist

Before deploying or sharing your project:

- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No secrets in source code
- [ ] Strong passwords/secrets set
- [ ] API keys are secure
- [ ] Database credentials are protected
- [ ] Debug files are excluded
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs or credentials

## 🚨 Emergency Response

If you accidentally commit sensitive data:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
